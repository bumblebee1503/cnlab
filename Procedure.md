A simplified procedure to create a LAN and WAN connection using two switches and two routers in Cisco Packet Tracer:

Setting Up the LAN and WAN:

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer:
   - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.

2. Add Devices:
   - Drag and drop the following devices from the left panel to the workspace:
     - 2 Routers
     - 2 Switches
     - 20 PCs (10 PCs for each LAN)

3. Connect Devices within Each LAN:
   - Connect PCs to Switches:
     - Use the Connections tool (lightning bolt icon).
     - Click on a PC, select FastEthernet0, and then click on the switch and select an available port. Repeat this for the second PC and switch.
   - Connect Switches to Routers:
     - Connect each switch to its respective router:
       - Click on the switch, select FastEthernet0/1 (or any other available port), then click on the router and select GigabitEthernet0/0 (or another available port).

4. Connect the Routers to Form a WAN:
   - Use a Serial or Ethernet cable to connect the two routers:
     - Click on one router, select Serial0/0/0 (or GigabitEthernet0/1 if using Ethernet), and then click on the other router and select the corresponding port.

5. Assign IP Addresses:
   - On the PCs:
     - Click on each PC, go to the Desktop tab, then click on IP Configuration.
     - Assign IP addresses within the same range for each LAN (e.g., 192.0.0.1 for the first PC, 192.0.0.2 for the second, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0).
   - On the Routers:
     - Double-click each router, go to the Config tab, and set IP addresses for the interfaces connected to the switches (e.g., 192.0.0.254 for the first routerâ€™s LAN interface) and the interface connecting to the other router (e.g., 192.0.0.1 and 192.0.0.2 for the serial interfaces connecting the routers).

6. Enable Routing Between LANs:
   - Go to each router's Config tab, find the Routing section, and add the connected networks to allow communication between the two LANs.

7. Test the Connectivity:
   - Use the Command Prompt on one PC to ping a PC in the other LAN to ensure they can communicate across the WAN.

This setup uses two routers and two switches to connect two LANs and form a WAN, allowing you to simulate both local and wide area network communication.
